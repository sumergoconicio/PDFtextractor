DESIGN
GUIDESOFTWARE© ArjanCodes
Have you ever been stuck trying to ﬁnd a way to write software that can solve a 
complex problem, but that doesn’t become a huge mess of spaghetti code? Do you 
often end up in a situation where you know what your software should eventually do, 
but you have no idea how or where to start? I’ve been there many times, just like you, 
and I’ve written this 7-step plan to help you consistently design great software that’s 
easy to work on.
When you design a new piece of software or add a new feature to an existing software 
application, there are lots of things to think about. It helps if you write down your 
thoughts about the design of your software (even if it’s just a smaller update). Not only 
will this make sure you don’t forget anything important, but it’s also going to train your 
design thinking skills.
I don’t recommend randomly writing down your thoughts though. It’s helpful to have a 
framework so you can more easily organize your thoughts. Below you ﬁnd the structure 
that I use, separated into 7 different sections. Beneath each section name, I’ve added a 
bullet list of the main points to cover in that section. I also added a few personal notes 
in each section (mostly some random thoughts and ramblings).
I hope you ﬁnd this useful and that it helps you in improving your software designs - 
let’s dive in!What is the software application or feature?
Who’s it intended for?
What problem does the software solve?
How is it going to work?
What are the main concepts that are involved and how are they related?01
DEFINE WHAT
YOU’RE BUILDING03
SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON02The very ﬁrst step is deﬁning what your software application or feature does. There are several 
standardized processes for this. Personally, I work a lot with Domain-Driven Design (by Eric Evans), 
even though that happened more as an emergent behavior than from me reading the book and 
applying the ideas.
The most important thing about domain-driven design is that it focuses on getting some sort of early 
implementation, a crude prototype, based on a model of the domain. In practice, don’t spend all your 
time coming up with the perfect design and then start implementing. Instead, do these things in 
parallel! As you come up with the design for your software by analyzing the domain, it’s incredibly 
helpful to start working on some sort of implementation. This allows you to get a feel for the technical 
setup of your software. You may uncover technical limitations that affect your software design. At the 
same time, analyzing the domain might also lead to new insights on how the technology should work. 
Don’t hesitate to remove things (this is called “distilling the model”). By removing things, you simplify 
your design and that lets you focus on what’s important: the core of what your software needs to do. 
Remember that the best type of refactoring is removing code.
When you deﬁne what a software application or feature does, what concepts are involved and how 
everything is related, I often follow a “zoom out and zoom in” approach. As a ﬁrst step, I try to think as 
broadly as possible about the software and what it would entail (“zoom out”). The funny thing that I’ve 
noticed over the years is that as I’ve become a more experienced software designer and developer, I’m 
spending more and more time in this conceptual stage, and less time implementing it. The 
implementation almost becomes an afterthought: it’s simply the ﬁnal step of translating the concepts 
and relationships that I wrote down into code that a computer can understand and run. However, 
especially if you adopt the methodology of doing design and implementation in tandem, the 
boundaries between design and implementation tend to become blurry.
After zooming out, you need to zoom in again. What should we do ﬁrst? Are there parts we can delay 
building? What’s the low hanging fruit? How does the order of building things impact the complexity of 
the work? Are there parts we should build ﬁrst so we can test everything quicker, leading to more 
efﬁcient development later?
From a business perspective, this is also called deﬁning an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The aim is 
to do the minimum work necessary in order to be able to test whether the thing you’re building is useful 
and (if applicable) can form the basis of a business.

SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ONDESIGN THE USER EXPERIENCE
What are the main user stories (happy ﬂows + alternative ﬂows)?
If you’re adding a new feature to an existing software application, what impact does the 
feature have on the overall structure of the interface? (are there big changes in the 
organization of menus, navigation, and so on?)
You can also provide UI mockups or wireframes here as a part of the user stories to clarify 
what the ﬂows are going to look like.
When I design software, I always must remind myself that I’m doing this for someone else, 
not for me to pat myself on the back for ﬁnding such a nice design. What you design must 
make sense to the user. Sometimes, that means you need to introduce an extra concept to 
clarify how your system works. And sometimes the most generic solution is not the best 
solution for the user.
For example, in the past I worked on a software 
platform for schools and universities. We wanted to add 
an analytics dashboard to the platform. I created this 
very generic solution that allowed customers to create 
their own analytics dashboard and deﬁne custom 
analytics blocks where customers could write their own 
Python code to do the actual analytics. It was a very 
generic and powerful solution, but not a single 
customer used it, because they simply didn’t need 
complex analytics.
My mistake was that I didn’t check whether users 
actually needed something before I built it. Nowadays, I 
keep things simple and make sure to only spend time on 
implementing things that I know users are going to 
beneﬁt from. In my experience, building user interfaces 
is one of the most time-consuming things of building 
software. Especially since every user interface change 
also means writing documentation, communicating 
about it with your existing users, and potentially 
introducing bugs that you need to solve in the future.

SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON02UNDERSTAND THE
TECHNICAL NEEDS
What technical details need developers to know to develop the software or new feature?
Are there new tables to add to the database? What ﬁelds?
How will the software technically work? Are there particular algorithms or libraries that 
are important?
What will be the overall design? Which classes are needed? What design patterns are 
used to model the concepts and relationships?
What third-party software is needed to build the software or feature?

SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON0307You can use UML to draw out the main classes that will be added and how they ﬁt into the rest of the 
system. I like to use Mermaid for drawing diagrams as this is text-based. Also, many tools for 
developers such as GitHub or VS Code have support for rendering Mermaid diagrams.
When writing code, there are a few simple things you can keep in mind that will help you write code 
that’s easy to maintain:
a. Use functions over classes.
In my experience, functional code is typically simpler than object-oriented code. Especially in languages 
like Python or Rust, it’s easy to write great functional code as these languages have good support for 
functional programming concepts. If you notice you need to pass along too many things as arguments 
to your functions, or if you need some sort of object representation for data, that’s a great time to 
introduce a class.
b. Keep things small and simple.
This is true whether you’re thinking about modules, functions, methods, or the number of instance 
variables in a class. Your code will be easier to read and test.
c. Separate creating the thing from using the thing.
Don’t create an object and then immediately call methods on it. Instead, create the object outside of the 
function and pass it as an argument. This will make your code easier to test.
d. Use abstraction.
In Python, you can use ABCs or Protocols. In Rust, you can use Traits. Either way, these help you remove 
dependencies, and this reduces the chance of breaking things when you work on your code.
Just doing these things already helps tremendously with keeping your code simple and easy to work 
on. I often talk about concepts like these in the videos on my YouTube channel, so check those out for 
more details and code examples.
Finally, something that you might want to address in this step is to describe speciﬁc edge cases that 
you want the system to handle correctly, for example what should happen in case of a network 
connection error.07
SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON
IMPLEMENT TESTING AND
SECURITY MEASURES
Are there speciﬁc coverage goals for the unit tests?
What kinds of tests are needed (unit, regression, end-to-end, and so on)?
(new feature only) Are there any potential side-effects on other areas of the application 
when adding this feature?
What security checks need to be in place to allow the software to ship?
(new feature only) How does the feature impact the security of the software? Is there a 
need for a security audit before the feature is shipped?

SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON04Everybody always talks about how important testing is, mainly 
because it helps you ﬁnd bugs and produce better, more reliable code. 
That’s part of it, but there’s a way more important reason to make 
testing part of how you operate though: by designing and writing 
code that is easy to test, you develop a tester’s mindset. A mindset 
that every piece of code potentially breaks something. A mindset that 
takes edge cases into account by default. If you adopt this mindset, 
you’ll start to automatically organize your code such that edge cases 
are handled almost automatically. Design interfaces, classes, and 
methods in such a way that they nudge the users into following the 
happy ﬂow.
For example, suppose you’re writing a function that retrieves users 
from your database with a particular role. You could use a string 
argument to specify the name of the role. The problem is that you 
open the possibility of calling that function with roles that don’t exist. 
And then you’d have to write extra code to handle that edge case, as 
well as extra tests to make sure you are handling it correctly. Another 
option is to use an Enum instead. Then, you’re relying on the typing 
system to handle the edge case for you, saving you a lot of extra work. 
This is why so many developers love languages with strict type 
checking: they detect problems early on, so you don’t have to deal 
with them later when the code is already shipped, and customers are 
experiencing bugs.09
SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ONIn general, make sure that your code is easy to work on. It’s going to 
help if you settle on a coding standard and use supporting tools to 
make your life easier. Don’t try to be too fancy. In case of Python, 
having an automatic formatter like Black or Ruff will already help just 
like following the best practices for coding in Python (I have many 
videos on my channel covering this in-depth).
Python is very loose with regards to typing and errors. When you just 
start coding, this is nice, because you can get started very quickly 
without having to think too much about edge cases. However, in the 
long run this does mean that as developer, you need to develop a 
good sense of how your scripts are going to be used. Rust on the other 
hand is the complete opposite: it has a sizable learning curve and 
when you write Rust code for the ﬁrst time, you might feel like you’re 
constantly ﬁghting with the compiler. However, this does mean that 
you are forced to deal with edge cases before shipping your code, 
resulting in more robust software.
Write your tests with the assumption that you’re going to change 
things during your development process: don’t focus on reaching 
100% test coverage no matter what. Instead, focus on getting a basic 
version of the feature done so you can evaluate whether this is really 
what you or your users want. In fact, assume that every line of code 
you write you’re going to throw away at some point: don’t get 
attached to the code you write.PLAN THE WORK
How much time will it cost to develop the software or feature?
What are the steps and how much time does step take?
What are the developmental milestones and in what order?
Are there any migration scripts that need to be written?
What are the main risk factors and are there any alternative routes to take if you ﬁnd out 
something isn’t feasible?
What parts are absolutely required, and what parts can optionally be done at a later 
stage? (i.e. the Deﬁnition of Done)
Especially if you’re a beginning 
developer, it’s hard to estimate how 
much time developing a piece of 
software takes. You will get better at 
this after doing it a couple of times. 
What helps me is ﬁrst ﬁguring out 
what the main risk factors are. For 
example, if you want to add a feature 
that allows users to integrate your 
app with Microsoft Teams, the main 
risk factor is the process of building 
the actual integration code (which 
will probably reside partly in the 
Teams App store), and not the user 
interface additions in your app to set 
it up. The more risk factors you have 
in the software design, the more time 
you need to reserve for nasty 
surprises.10
SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON05IDENTIFY RIPPLE EFFECTS
What needs to be done outside of designing and implementing the feature?
What documentation needs to be updated?
Do you need to communicate something to existing users?
Are there other external systems that need to be updated? For example, a payment 
provider, email marketing, sales system?
As a technical person, it’s easy to fall into the trap that the only thing that needs to be done is build 
the actual software or feature. However, I’ve learned that all the processes and tasks around 
software development, releasing it to the customer, and making sure customers can successfully 
use the software, take up a lot of time. Though it might not always be important, and you may not 
be the person who does these tasks, I ﬁnd it helpful to already think about these things when I work 
on software, so they don’t come up at the last minute.
Especially for software that has many users, thinking about the ripple effects of changing the 
software is crucial. This is also why it sometimes feels like larger software companies move 
incredibly slow. It’s because the ripple effects for large companies are huge, so they need to spend 
a lot of time making sure these are properly handled! 11
SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON06UNDERSTAND THE
BROADER CONTEXT
What are limitations of the current design?
What are possible extensions to think about for the future?
Any other considerations to take into account such as a budget?
Whenever I design software, I always like to include a few “moonshot” ideas: “It would be really cool 
if the software could also do X”. The reason this is useful is that this puts you in a very open mindset 
that sometimes leads to new insights. Also, when you’re developing the software, it’s possible that 
you get an epiphany that allows you to add one of these moonshot ideas. It’s awesome when that 
happens!
Finally, knowing the limitations of your design will help you improve the software in the long term as 
this will give you an immediate starting point whenever you need to make changes to your software 
in the future.

SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE | A GUIDE FOR DESIGNING GREAT SOFTWARE THAT’S EASY TO WORK ON07You may have noticed that I didn’t really talk much about design patterns in this guide. This is on 
purpose. The most important phase of coming up with a great design is understanding the problem 
you’re trying to solve. This is a step that a lot of developers skip, but it’s a crucial part of designing 
great software!
Learning about and becoming comfortable with design patterns and principles is the next phase 
though, so I promise that I’ll discuss them at length with you in the future. In the meantime, I hope 
this guide gives you something to think about as we begin working together to help you become a 
software design expert.
So, was this guide helpful to you? I’d love to hear your feedback. Feel free to send me an email!
